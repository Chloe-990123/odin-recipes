    <p>Poutine: French fires topped with brown gravy and cheese curds. It sounds weird, but trust me, no one hates poutine. You either love it, or you've never tried it before. </p> 

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 (10.25 ounce) can beef gravy</li>
        <li>5 medium potatoes, cut into fries</li>
        <li>2 cups cheese curds</li>
    </ul> 

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, begin to warm gravy.</li>
        <li>Place fries into the hot oil, and cook until light brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Cook fries in batches if necessary to allow them room to move a little in the oil. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
        <li>Place fries on a serving platter, and sprinkle cheese over them. Ladle warmed gravy over the fries and cheese, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
